# session43 — track

## 2026-08-16 — boot

- Booted per `agents/validation.md` + `agents/sessions.md`. Fresh start:
  session43 held only `prompt.md`; no track or report existed.
- HEAD `b54c0778` `docs(session42): wrap P9c and P13 work`. No tracked
  modifications; only the known untracked scratch (`claude.sh`,
  `input-pr-slices.tar.gz`, `src/STEPS.md`, `worklog.md`, `doc/tall_blocks.md`,
  `repos.txt`) and the nested example repos.
- Baseline confirmed: `busted tests` → **947 / 0 / 0 / 10**, matching the
  session43 prompt's authoritative number (validation.md's fallback 946 is
  stale by one — session42's P13 added a case). Ten pending are sanctioned.
- Read session42 `prompt.md`, `track.md`, `report.md`, and the follow-up cold
  review. One open item: S2 — `setup_harmony` in
  `tests/harmony_input_spec.lua:18-42` is a 23-line body, over the 14-line
  hard limit.
- Prompt mandate: **wait for owner direction**; do not select a sprint task.
  Reported the state to the owner and am holding.

## 2026-08-16 — owner contests their own P13 ruling

- Owner asked what P9c/P13 were (verified independently of session42's report)
  and challenged the retirement of harmony's `release_keys()` discipline as a
  possible behaviour change, not a mechanism swap.
- **The challenge lands, and harder than framed.** `love_key` pushes and clears
  `held` synchronously; `love.event.push` only enqueues; the queue drains one
  frame later, after `love.update` advanced the scenario. So `held` is already
  false when the app handles the key, and `patch_isDown`/`Key.ctrl()` answer
  false. Every scripted chord now arrives as a bare key.
- A/B probes under realistic queue semantics: pre-P13 Ctrl+T fires quickswitch
  (`Key.ctrl()` true), HEAD does not (`nil`). Session42's spec passes only
  because its fixture dispatches on push.
- The owner's 2026-08-09 ruling was conditional ("retire ... **if** that
  confirms"); the confirmation used the synchronous fixture, so the condition
  was never met.
- Materialized: `validation/notes/S43-harmony-p13-timing-finding.md` +
  `validation/notes/S43-harmony-probes/`. No code changed; awaiting ruling.
