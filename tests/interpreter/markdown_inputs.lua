### Projects

A _project_ is a folder in the application's storage which
contains at least a `main.lua` file. Projects can be loaded and
ran. At any time, pressing <kbd>Ctrl-Shift-Q</kbd> quits and
returns to the console

- `list_projects()`

  List available projects.

#### Searching

Definitions can be searched with <kbd>Ctrl-F</kbd>. Pressing
this combination switches to search mode, in which the
definitions are listed, and there's a highlight, which can be
moved as usual. Hitting <kbd>Enter ⏎</kbd> returns to editing,
highlighting the selected definition. To exit search mode
without moving, press <kbd>Esc</kbd>.
